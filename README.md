Using strong passwords can help shield against traditional password attacks such as dictionary, rainbow tables, or brute-force attacks. You need strong passwords so these strong password generator tools will help keep you safe from being attacked online.

# Requirements

1.import the python random module to get random characters in each set.\
2.create 4 lists that are holding uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.\
3.use random.choice() to choose one random character in each list. so that I can get one random character from alphabets, chars, small and numbers.\
4.combine all of them in a string format, now I got a new random word with 4 character length. but we need at least 8 characters.
